# commonsio
common io, file ops, and housekeeping library for golang
For common io, file ops, and housekeeping jobs many programming languages have libraries besides their std lib which help reduce verbosity and cognitive load for devs.

Example : java has one from ASF, which identifies few common io and file utilities as follows:

FileFilters : filtering files in a directory based on different criteria such as file age, file size, name matching etc.
IOUtils : reducing verbosity of the code that reads, writes, and copies files
Here, we will attempt to create similar library for go.
